# AFL Player Performance Predictor

> **McGill University MMA8 · INSY 684 Enterprise Data Science & ML in Production**

A production-grade machine learning system that predicts goals scored per player per AFL game. Built on causal inference findings from Course 1, the system serves predictions via a FastAPI REST API with SHAP-based explainability, automated drift monitoring, a fairness audit, and a full CI/CD pipeline.

## Business Problem

AFL clubs make multi-million dollar decisions on player selection, in-game substitution, opponent analysis, and recruitment — largely based on intuition and scout reports. This system provides a data-backed decision-support layer: given a player's match statistics and physical attributes, how many goals are they predicted to score, and why?

**Core questions answered:**
1. What is this player's predicted goal output for this game?
2. Which features drove that prediction? (SHAP explainability)
3. Is the model equally accurate across positions, ages, and teams? (Fairness audit)
4. Is the model still reliable as player populations shift over time? (Drift monitoring)

## Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Algorithm | XGBRegressor |
| Target | Goals per player per game |
| R² | **0.4890** |
| MAE | **0.4293 goals** |

| Training data | 101,692 rows, 2012–2025 (chronological 80/20 split) |
| Test set | 25,424 rows, 2018–2025 |

**Position prediction range:**

| Position | Sample Profile | Predicted Goals |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Forward | 22 disposals, 3 MarksInside50, 85% played | 2.14 |
| Midfield | 28 disposals, 8 clearances, 100% played | 0.53 |
| Ruck | 18 disposals, 35 hitouts, 100% played | 0.22 |
| Defender | 20 disposals, 8 rebounds, 100% played | 0.05 |

## Causal Findings (Course 1)

These findings from Course 1 causal analysis inform the feature choices and model interpretation.

### Average Treatment Effects (ATE)

| Treatment | Position | Outcome | ATE | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----|----------------|
| Height | Ruck | HitOuts | **+3.66** | Taller rucks win significantly more hitouts |
| Weight | Ruck | HitOuts | **+4.22** | Heavier rucks dominate contests |
| BMI | Forward | Goals | **+0.64** | Physicality benefits scoring |

### Rule Change Impact

| Rule | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 6-6-6 (2019) | +2,226% increase in height effect for Rucks — structurally changed positional roles |
| Rotation Caps | −97% reduction in weight advantage for Midfielders |

### Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)

Age moderates physical attribute effects significantly:

| Segment | Height → HitOuts (Ruck) |
|---------|------------------------|
| Young (<23) | **+8.16** |
| Prime (23–28) | +0.95 |
| Veteran (>28) | −2.21 |

## Fairness Audit

The model was audited across 27 groups in 4 dimensions on the chronological test set (n = 25,424).

| Group | Result | Key Finding |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Forward | FLAGGED | MAE ratio 1.40× — harder to predict |
| Midfield | FLAGGED | R² gap 0.23 — low explained variance |
| Ruck | PASS | — |
| Defender | PASS | — |
| Age (all 3 segments) | PASS | Age parity holds |
| Pre-6-6-6 era | FLAGGED | R² gap 0.157; n=568 — monitoring signal |
| Carlton, Richmond | FLAGGED | Under-represented profiles |
| 16 other teams | PASS | No significant disparity |
