# AFL Player Performance Predictor — Production ML System

> **McGill University MMA8 · INSY 684 Enterprise Data Science & ML in Production**

A production-grade machine learning system that predicts goal-scoring probability and player performance for AFL (Australian Football League) players. Built on causal inference findings from Course 1, this system brings the model to production with a FastAPI serving layer, automated drift monitoring, SHAP explainability, and a full CI/CD pipeline.

## Business Problem

AFL teams make multi-million dollar decisions on player selection, recruitment, and in-game strategy — yet most decisions still rely on intuition rather than evidence. Our system gives coaching departments a data-backed decision-support tool: given a player's attributes and game context, how likely are they to score, and *why*?

**Core questions we answer:**
1. What is this player's predicted performance in this game context?
2. Which factors drive that prediction? (SHAP explainability)
3. Is the model fair across different positions and teams?
4. Is the model still reliable as player data drifts over time?

## Key Results (from Course 1 Causal Analysis)

These findings from our causal inference work directly inform the feature engineering and model interpretation in this production system.

### Average Treatment Effects (ATE)

| Treatment | Position | Outcome | ATE (XGBoost) | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Height | Ruck | HitOuts | **+3.66** | Taller rucks win significantly more hitouts |
| Weight | Ruck | HitOuts | **+4.22** | Heavier rucks dominate contests |
| BMI | Forward | TotalScore | **+0.64** | Physicality benefits all positions |
| BMI | Midfield | Clearances | **+0.62** | Modern game rewards physicality everywhere |
| Height | Forward | TotalScore | +0.06 | Minimal height benefit for forwards |
| Home | Ruck | HitOuts | +0.20 | Home advantage is ruck-specific |

### Rule Change Impact

| Rule | Position | Change | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| 6-6-6 (2019) | Ruck | +2,226% | Made height dramatically more valuable |
| Rotation Caps | Midfield | −97% | Nearly eliminated weight advantage for mids |
| Stand Rule | Midfield | ~0% | Negligible effect on clearances |

### Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)

Key finding: **age and career stage moderate the physical attribute advantages significantly.**
- Young rucks (<23): Height ATE = +8.16 hitouts (strongest effect)
- Prime forwards (23–28): Height ATE = +0.84 (positive)
- Veteran forwards (>28): Height ATE = −0.51 (diminishing returns)

### Predictive Model Performance

| Position | Target | R² (Test) | MAE (Test) | Model |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Forward | TotalScore | 0.49 | 4.37 | LassoCV |
| Midfield | Clearances | 0.52 | 1.42 | LassoCV |

**Validation strategy:** Chronological split — train through 2022, validate 2023–2024, test 2025.

**Top predictors:**
- Forward: `MarksInside50` (coeff: +9.75), `Frees`, `Disposals`
- Midfield: `Disposals` (coeff: +2.54), efficiency > volume
